# FriendFinder-App


This is a silly mock dating site.

You may register for an account and answer some questions. The questions work similarly to a corporate personality test, i.e. with one exception, you choose how much you agree with the posted statement on a scale from 1 - 5, 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest.

Your answers are then compared with those of other registered users. The user who answered most similarly to you will appear in a modal.

Installation
You need to clone or download repo.
Go to the directory and Run the command npm install
It will install npm packages needed to run FriendFinder
Run command node server
It will start web server with port 8080
Access to localhost:8080 and you are good to go :)

Have fun!
